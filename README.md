# Facade-Pattern-Book
This code provides a facade (LibraryFacade) for a library management system, where users can borrow and return books, search for books by title or author, and check the availability of a particular book. It hides the complexity of the underlying subsystems (BookInventory and UserManagement) and provides a simplified interface for these operations.
